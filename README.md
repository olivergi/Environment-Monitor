Android University Project using Bluetooth Sensors


This application is an android operating system based application thats purpose is to use the device's internal sensors and possible
bluetooth connected external sensor. 
The data gathered from these sensors is then displayed and compared with each other in the form of graphs.

This project was a part of a course in my studies where me and my team achieved the requirements more than efficiently.
